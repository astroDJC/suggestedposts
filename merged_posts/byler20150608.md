# The "Matilda Effect" and the "Genius Effect"
***The Matilda Effect*** - The systematic under-recognition of women's contributions to science. Infamous examples from physics and astronomy include Leise Meitner's Nobel snub, Jocelyn Bell Burnell's Nobel snub, "Pickering's Harem" of female computers.

***The Genius Effect*** - That some fields (namely the hard sciences) require "innate genius" for success. This can serve to dissuade potential participants, predominantly groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.

### Discussion Questions

* Have people assumed certain characteristics/behavior/roles of you that are "gendered"?
* Do you think this has an affect in the astronomical community on say, citation counts? Is being aware of the bias enough to combat it?
* Can you think of other things that are important to success other than "natural ability"?
* Can you think of ways to introduce material in your Astro 101 labs that could demphasize the need for ability to succeed?
* Can fictional geniuses hold back real people?
