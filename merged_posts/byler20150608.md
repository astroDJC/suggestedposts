***The Genius Effect*** - the idea that some fields require "natural ability" for success

### Discussion Questions

* Have people assumed certain characteristics/behavior/roles of you that are "gendered"?
* Do you think this has an affect in the astronomical community on say, citation counts? Is being aware of the bias enough to combat it?
* Can you think of other things that are important to success other than "natural ability"?
* Can you think of ways to introduce material in your Astro 101 labs that could demphasize the need for ability to succeed?
* Can fictional geniuses hold back real people?
