***The Matilda Effect*** - The systematic under-recognition of women's contributions to science. Infamous examples from physics and astronomy include Leise Meitner's Nobel snub, Jocelyn Bell Burnell's Nobel snub, and "Pickering's Harem" of female computers. Research has shown that women recieve grants less often, smaller grant allocations, fewer scientific awards, and less citations (Wenneras & Wold, 1997; Bornmann, Mutz, & Daniel, 2007; Lincoln, Pincus, Koster & Leboy, 2012). 

A recent experiment investigating gender bias in science found that both male and female faculty found female applicants for a lab manager position less hireable and less compentent; ultimately offering lower salaries and fewer mentoring opportunities (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012). In earlier career stages, peer evaluations are imporant for grant proposals, promotions, and networking. The authors of this study found that abstracts from male authors were associated with greater "scientific quality" than those with female authors, and that the effect was stronger when the topic was stereotyped as "male-typed". While the differences in evaluations are not large, small effects can multiply over a career.

### Discussion Questions

* Personal experiences: with your nearest neighbor or two, share something you have witnessed/experienced/perpetrated - words, characteristics/behaviors that are "gendered"? Do you sign your name on papers with your first initials only? 
* In the astronomical community: do you think this has an affect on citation counts?  Is a blind peer review really blind? Is being aware of the bias enough to combat it?
* Is publication rate an equal opportunity metric?
