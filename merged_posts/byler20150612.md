# White Privilege
#### Contributed by [Nell Byler](http://staff.washington.edu/ebyler)

Racism did not begin and end with Jim Crow. Fighting racism isn't just about battling hate crimes and overtly discrimanatory laws. To paraphrase Peggy McIntosh, racism is more than just individual acts of meanness -- it's the invisible system that bestows unearned advantages and power to one group of people and denies those advantages to another. Often, those benefitting from privilege are unaware of how it has made their life easier and better. Acknowleging this privilege - that subtle racism exists and that you benefit from it - is the first step to becoming a more effective ally.

"White privelege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and black checks." -- Peggy McIntosh. 

Unpack your own invisible knapsack and recognize the benefits you reap every day solely for looking like you do. 

**Note:** One very common response to discussions of white privilege is to play the "trump card" of socioeconomic class; I intentionally link to an article that addresses this (resource 2). It's important to understand that privilege takes many forms - people can be privileged in some ways and not privileged in others (think: citizenship, class, sexual orientation and ability). It's also important to understand that all privilege is not created equal - and intersectionality allows us to examine the varying dimensions and degrees of discrimination.
