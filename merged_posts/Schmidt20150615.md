# Cognitive Costs of the Colorblind Narrative

#### Contributed by [Sarah Jane Schmidt](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~schmidt/)

There are two opposing narratives that describe the inclusion of ethnic minorities in the workplace. Colorblindness downplays 
the differences between people of different ethnicities and focuses on their shared humanity (similar to "not seeing race") while 
multiculturalism highlights the differences between those people. While the colorblind narrative currently dominates our society, 
it is problematic for many reasons (and is often used as an excuse to ignore white privilege).

This study (Holoien & Shelton 2012) was designed to study cognitive depletion of ethnic minorities in paired interactions with 
white people. In 78 total same-sex pairs (31 white/white, 25 white/asian, 23 white/black), the white person (or one of the white 
people) was given an ideological prime designed to champion either colorblindness or multicultrualism. The pair then interacted 
for 5 minutes about race (which was filmed an coded), then each participant took a test designed to measure cognitive performance (essentially, measuring 
how quickly and well each one is thinking).

During the pair's interactions about race, white people who were primed with colorblindness were more likely to downplay to importance 
of racial issues and say more racist things and their ethnic minority partners were more cognitively depleted. The white people who 
were primed with multiculturalism were less racist and their ethnic minority partners were less cognitively depleted. The conclusion 
is that the colorblind narritive causes cognitive depletion for ethnic minorities.
