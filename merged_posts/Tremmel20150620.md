# The Pre-Major in Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP): An Evaluation of a College Diversity Initiative

#### Contributed by [Michael Tremmel ](http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/mjt29/)

During the past 10 years, the Pre-Major In Astronomy Program (Pre-MAP) at the University of Washington (UW) has been a concerted efford to recruit and retain underrepresented students in STEM fields. The program, which was started and is currently ran almost entirely by UW graduate students, is meant to give beginning undergraduate students an introduction to scientific research in astronomy. The bulk of the program takes place in the form of a seminar taught by a graduate student where students learn computer programming (Unix, bash, python, etc), practice reading scientific articles, and, in the latter half of the course, get paired up with mentors to work on a short (5 week) research project.
